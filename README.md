### [DEPLOYED APP](https://predi-rayymyqdp-millicentmalinga.vercel.app/)

## Overview
This application is designed to predict the likelihood of lung, breast, cervical, and prostate cancer using machine learning models trained with the XGBoost classifier. 

## Models
The application uses four distinct models, each trained to predict a specific type of cancer:

1. **Lung Cancer Model**: Predicts the likelihood of lung cancer.
2. **Breast Cancer Model**: Predicts the likelihood of breast cancer.
3. **Cervical Cancer Model**: Predicts the likelihood of cervical cancer.
4. **Prostate Cancer Model**: Predicts the likelihood of prostate cancer.

## Performance
The breast, cervical, and prostate cancer models are performing well. However, the lung cancer model is currently underperforming due to the small size of the dataset used for training. We are actively seeking a larger, more comprehensive dataset to improve the performance of this model.

## Usage
To use the application, input the required medical data for the patient. The application will output the likelihood of the patient having each type of cancer.

## Contributions
Contributions to improve the application are welcome. Please submit a pull request or open an issue if you have any suggestions or find any bugs.
